# Landscape ecology of an invasive primate in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest

Here we present data and scripts for analysis as supplementary material of the article 
"Disentangling the effects of anthropogenic and habitat factors on the distribution of an invasive primate" 
by de Morais-Jr. et al.

The repository has 3 folders: **bla bla bla describe it better**
- [code](https://github.com/LEEClab/ms_landscape_ecology_invase_primate_MoraisJr_etal/tree/master/code): An R script for running analyses and plotting some figures.
- [data](https://github.com/LEEClab/ms_landscape_ecology_invase_primate_MoraisJr_etal/tree/master/data): The data for the analysis. It includes:
  1. A survey of the literature on movement ecology in Brazil, in the period 1985-2005, performed in the scientific citation index [Web of ScienceÂ®](https://webofknowledge.com). The data are presented in `xls` and `csv` formats.
  2. Questionnaires answered by the participants of the I Movement Ecology Brazil Workshop, in 2015. The data are presented in `xls` and `csv` formats.
  3. A metadata document, explaining in details the columns of the literature and I MEB data.
  4. A [folder](https://github.com/LEEClab/Movement_Ecology_Brazil_1985-2015/tree/master/Data/shapes) containin a map of Brazilian states, as well as the location of movement ecology research groups in Brazil.
- [output](https://github.com/LEEClab/ms_landscape_ecology_invase_primate_MoraisJr_etal/tree/master/output): A folder where figures and files are saved, in case the analyses are run.
